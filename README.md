 - While the avg. temp for June and December are only 3 degrees different, the min. temp. between the two months is more than double that at 8 degrees different. 
 - The lower quartiles also are not that far apart at only around ~4 degrees difference, showing that the fluctutaion between the two months doesnt vary that much.
 - The upper qaurtile between the two months is also very small at ~3 degrees difference, showing that there are around the same number of good weather days in the two months.
## Summary.
To get a better idea of how many "good" days each month has, I just looked for the days that were above 74 degrees.

  - June has 966/1700 for a "Good Day percentage" 58%, Decemember has 261/1517 for a "Good day percentage" of 17.2%. While this may not seem ideal, 5 days out of 30 that are perfect temputure days in the grand scheme of things is still good.  It goes to show that even in the worst month, a month won't be completely wiped out from cold temputures and the bussiness can still be viable even in the worst month.
